    summary: I worked in multiple NodeJS projects that had to be connected to multiple databases and softwares at the same time. Every time I start a new project, I first need to write the code that configures clients of databases (MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Redis...), make sure it connected successfully and then move on to what I want to do.
