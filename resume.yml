  summary: |-
    I'm just a !normal Software Engineer, I'm always curious about how things work and why it works. I've being coding since I was 15, I got my first job at 19, When I'm free, I work on side projects or learn new skills, When my brain is like: "brah, can I have a break", I watch Movies/TV Shows, or play games.
    I'm Something of a Digital Nomad Myself.

    summary: I worked in multiple NodeJS projects that had to be connected to multiple databases and softwares at the same time. Every time I start a new project, I first need to write the code that configures clients of databases (MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Redis...), make sure it connected successfully and then move on to what I want to do.

  reference: |-
    Comment résumer Ayoub en un seul paragraphe ? Cela est tout simplement impossible. Car il sera insuffisant.
    Dans ma vie professionnelle j’ai connu des développeurs, des Leeds tech, des chefs d’entreprise et des experts IT, mais Ayoub est d’une autre planète ! je n’ai jamais vu une personne aussi passionnée par les nouvelles technologies et le développement informatique avec autant de capacités, il est rigoureux, intelligent, super autonome avec une très bonne vision et plus, se lancer dans la programmation à l’âge de 14 ans tout seul avec ses propres moyens sans encadrement académique formel et travailler sur des projets informatiques personnelles et professionnelles et les réaliser avec succès dès l’âge de 19 ans, occuper le poste du Lead-Developer à l’âge de 23 ans dans société de Data-Intelligence et gérer sa propre entreprise en même temps montre à quel point ce jeune homme est extraordinaire. Pour moi Ayoub est un génie, et en vrai cela ne m'étonne pas car je sais de quoi il est capable et à quel point il est surprennant. Ayoub aujourd'hui est l'exemple du leader qu'on aime avoir dans son équipe, je te souhaite une bonne continuation mon ami.
